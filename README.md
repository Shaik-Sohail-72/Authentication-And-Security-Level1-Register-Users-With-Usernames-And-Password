# Authentication-Level1-Register-Users-With-Username-And-Password
Account creation for users to allow them to register and login so that they can finally view our secrets page of our website.
And in order to do this we're going to be using Level 1 security, so the lowest level possible of security for our website.

And this is simply just going to be creating an account for the user, storing their email and password in our database so that when they come back at a later date we can check their email against their password and see if we should let them pass or not.

So in order to create a user account and store these pieces of data then we're going to have to create a user database. So we're going to do that using Mongoose and MongoDB.

NOTE: Don't store users passwords in plain text. For more about how to provide security to the data, Read Authentication level-2 repository.
